## Real-Time 3D Object Detection and Sensor Fusion (Ongoing Research)

**(Optional: Add a key diagram, image, or GIF illustrating the concept here)**
### Goal
The primary goal of this ongoing research is to develop and evaluate robust, real-time 3D object detection systems specifically for autonomous driving scenarios by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and multi-sensor fusion.

### My Role & Contributions (as Researcher/Developer)
* Currently researching and implementing LiDAR-based 3D object detection techniques, focusing on voxel-based encoding methods and suitable deep learning architectures (e.g., VoxelNet, PointPillars, or newer approaches).
* Exploring and developing strategies for multi-sensor fusion, combining LiDAR point clouds with RGB camera data to improve perception accuracy and robustness in varying conditions.
* Investigating the challenges associated with deploying these complex models in real-time on edge computing platforms, including CUDA acceleration, latency optimization, and efficient data handling.
* Focusing on data-centric approaches for model evaluation and improvement.

### Technologies & Concepts Involved
* **Primary Focus:** 3D Object Detection, Sensor Fusion, Deep Learning, Real-time Systems
* **Sensors:** LiDAR, RGB Cameras
* **Data Representations:** Voxel Grids, Point Clouds, Camera Images
* **Frameworks/Libraries:** PyTorch or TensorFlow, Python
* **Acceleration:** CUDA
* **Platform:** Edge Computing Devices (Target), Linux/Ubuntu
* **Context:** Autonomous Driving Perception

### Approach & Implementation (Current Focus)
* Literature review and implementation of state-of-the-art voxel-based deep learning models for LiDAR object detection.
* Design and testing of fusion architectures (e.g., early, late, or deep fusion) to effectively combine LiDAR and camera features.
* Profiling and optimization of model components for latency reduction using techniques like model quantization, pruning, and hardware acceleration (CUDA).
* Development of comprehensive evaluation metrics considering both detection accuracy and computational performance.

### Expected Outcome / Results (Ongoing)
This research aims to contribute novel or improved methods for real-time 3D perception, potentially leading to publications or optimized models suitable for deployment in autonomous systems. Performance will be benchmarked against standard datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes) focusing on both accuracy (mAP) and speed (FPS).
